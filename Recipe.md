Here's the recipe of RED VELVET CAKE...

step 1 - First preheat your oven to 350F(176C).
        Now let's make our cake batter.Start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl.Use a hand mixre or stand mixer to do this process.
step 2 - Now add eggs in it (one at a time).   Drop one egg in  
        it,mix it well.Once the egg is completely incorporated,drop the another egg.Mix it well again.Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.
step 3 -  Now add cocoa powder.It is a good idea to run it through some kind of  a sifter.Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lunpy.Then mix it again and scrape the sides as needed.Throughout this whole process we don't wanna over mix, just untill things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air npockets in our cake.

step 4 - Add vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as white vinegar.If you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tbsp. of lemon juice or vinegar and let sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla eztract until conbined.

step 5 - Add oil to the buttermilk mixture.Then add in about 2 - 2 and 1/2 tbsp. of red food colouring liquid. Stir,until the mixture gets red in colour.

step 6 - Add salt and baking soda to the floor.You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. cake flour tends to work a  little bit batter ,but all - purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients. 

step 7 - Add about galf of the food colouring buttermilk mixture and about half of the flour mixture, then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leavine=g you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

step 8 - Now just fill upto two 9 inches cake pand=s wir=th equal amounts of cake batter.Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust then with cocoa powder or flour. Now bakke those cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step 9 - After the cakes come out of the oven ,allow them to cool in their pans  for about 10 minutes. After that we can remove them from the pans, remove the parchmant paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in fridge and let them chill,which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the frosting step now , it,s totally upto you!

step 10 - It's time to serve the cakes and eat them! Enjoy!!!
